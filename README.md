# ExtendScript Compiler

## Why?

To keep development of large ExtendScript projects easier to handle I split the projects into multiple files/modules and use [ExtendScript Preprocessor Directives](https://extendscript.docsforadobe.dev/extendscript-tools-features/preprocessor-directives.html) to source those files in a base script. This works great for me but is a pain for users to install....

So, to make script installation as easy as possible I needed an automated way to get everything compiled into a single readable '.jsx' script file.

> Previously I would just export to a JSXBIN file but I really wanted my open source scripts to be human readable...

## How it works...

The script reads through the supplied .jsx script file looking for any 'include' statements and replaces them with contents from that file.

```bash
./escompile.sh sample_jsx_project/src/script.jsx > sample_jsx_project/compiledScript.jsx
```

⚠️ You may need to make the script executable before running the command above.

## What can it detect?

This script tries to process `include` and `includepath` statements just as the ExtendScript engine does.

### include file

Inserts the contents of the named file into the output at the location of this statement.

> 🙌 Nested include files starting in v0.3.0!

```javascript
#include "../include/lib.jsxinc"
//@include "../include/file.jsxinc"
```

If the file to be included cannot be found, the script throws an error.

### includepath path

One or more paths that the #include statement should use to locate the files to be included. The semicolon (;) separates path names.

If a `#include` file name starts with a slash (/), it is an absolute path name, and the include paths are ignored. Otherwise, the script attempts to find the file in any of the `#includepath` paths previously defined in your script.

```javascript
#includepath "include;../include"
#include "file.jsxinc"
//@includepath "include;../include"
//@include "file.jsxinc"
```

Multiple #includepath statements are allowed; the list of paths updates each time an #includepath statement is executed.
